# hubspot-orm

Goals of this library:

* fully type safe access to hubspot REST API to access all types in hubspot like contacts, deals, and especially including custom types

* code first approach to maintaining the types and property in hubspot. just like any standard ORM like prisma, you define all the types in code and then run a migration to update hubspot.
